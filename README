This is the subroutine library NLPAPI, for defining nonlinear programming problems. It is a 
preliminary release.

The API provides routines to invoke LANCELOT and Ipopt. The routines are disabled if the 
corresponding package is not installed. To use LANCELOT you must provide the top directory in
which it was installed using the with-LANCELOT=dir option to configure, or in the share/config.site
file (LANCELOT build object files). In addition, LANCELOT has options to use Harwell routines. You
can provide these by the with-hsl=<opt> option, where <opt> contains the load flags to link
the routines (e..g configure with-hsl="-L/local/lib -lHSL"). Finally, Ipopt is done the same
way, via the with-ipopt=<opt> option. Again <opt> contains the link flags. Ipopt requires
Lapack, Harwell and BLAS, so -l flags may need to be included for those.

NOTE: The current version of Ipopt is not threadsafe!

To install:
        edit share/config.site to define where LANCELOT, Ipopt and the Harwell subroutine
           library are installed.

	./configure
	make

   if you want to install the libraries, includes and binaries somewhere else, you can use something like

        ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

   and then

        make install

   will copy them there. "./configure --help" explains all this. Or just copy the things yourself.
