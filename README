Manifold.

This is the subroutine library NLPAPI, for defining nonlinear programming problems. It is a 
preliminary release.

To install:
        edit share/config.site to define where LANCELOT is installed.
	./configure
	make

   if you want to install the libraries, includes and binaries somewhere else, you can use something like

        ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

   and then

        make install

   will copy them there. "./configure --help" explains all this. Or just copy the things yourself.

Documentation is in Doc/NLPAPI-UG.tex and Doc/NLPAPI-Ref.tex
