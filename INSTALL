To install NLPAPI:
        edit share/config.site to define where LANCELOT, Ipopt and the Harwell subroutine
           library are installed.

	./configure
	make

   if you want to install the libraries, includes and binaries somewhere else, you can use something like

        ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

   and then

        make install

   will copy them there. "./configure --help" explains all this. Or just copy the things yourself.
